# moai Keyboard

![Moai](gallery/photo1.png)

A small, 34 key, low(ish) profile keyboard with MX switches.

![Moai Detail](gallery/photo2.png)

The keyboard is caseless, using just the plate and the pcb, with a maple woodcut (3.3mm height) between both. No screws, the soldered switches keep everything in place.

The wood gives enough stability and it's quite sturdy compared to other caseless builds I've done before (even the ones that used screws).

The texture on top of the plate is created poking holes on the `Cu` layer below; tried just this once and results where better than expected; As the plate is simmetrical I created two designs (one on each side), but only used the textured one for now.

> **Word of advice** : The distance between each pair of thumb keys is tenths of a millimeter less than the standard for 1.25U keys, this is intentional. I have found no incompatibilities in any keycap profiles thrown at it (Cherry, MDA/XVX, XDA, SDA, MT3, etc) from several vendors, but your milleage may vary.
