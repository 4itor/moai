# Building a Moai

_(Under construction)_

## Bill of Materials

* 1x Moai PCB (see Kicad file)
* 1x Moai Plate (see Kicad file)
* 1x Wood/Acrylic middle layer
    * laser cut 3.3mm width panel, see middle_later.dxf
* 1x Low profile microcontroller
    * 0xCB Helios, Frood RP2040, Elite-Pi, Elite-C LowProfile, etc. It should be able to be soldered flat on top of the pcb with components up (so no components on the bottom) and height has to be approx 3.2mm or below.
    * I tried 0xCB, Frood and Elite-Pi and those three worked well.
* 34x diodes 1N4148
    * could be either through hole or SMD

## 1. Preparing PCB and Plate

...

## 2. Soldering the Diodes

The PCB supports both through the hole or smd diodes, and both abobe and below the PCB.

## 4. Soldering the switches

...

## 5. Keycaps

> **Word of advice** : The distance between each pair of thumb keys is tenths of a millimeter less than the standard for 1.25U keys, this is intentional. I have found no incompatibilities in any keycap profiles trown at it (Cherry, MDA/XVX, XDA, SDA, MT3, etc) from several vendors, but your milleage may vary.
